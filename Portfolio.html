        <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">RCSB - Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics</a>
        <p>RCSB was my first foray into Front-End Team Lead. I worked with a small team of Junior Developers to
          implement new features, maintain legacy code, bug fix, work with 3rd party services, and otherwise keep
          RCSB.org and <a href="https://pdb101.rcsb.org/">PDB101.RCSB.org</a> in tip-top shape.<br><br>RCSB was largely
          concerned with funcationality and providing the scientific community (our primary user base) the best features
          with the most complete data. UI/UX was on the drawing board, but did not have priority over improving the data
          and functionality.

        <a href="https://community.atlassian.com/">Atlassian Community</a>
        <p>Community.Atlassian.com was a fairly robust legacy project. Built on top of the Khoros platform, Khoros
          provides a lot of the fundamental forum features that we know and expect from these sorts of websites.
          Atlassian has a lot of ideas about what should be provided to users, so the implementation and maintenance of
          numerous features, such as gamification, notifications, 3rd party integrations were all part and parcel.

        <p>Working with everyone at Thorium Digital, we put together this full stack project. A full stack project, I
          primarily worked on UI and UX implementations. Filling in gaps in the design documents and providing the user
          with a seamless experience on all device sizes. I also handled a few prototype features (mostly UX flourishes)
          that didn't end up making the cut, as they didn't sit well with users.

        <p>While at Thorium I was the primary developer for content updates on Baileys.com. Which was a little sobering
          as a Junior Developer, but pretty fun to work on!

        <p>Kikori is a Japanese rice whiskey. Originally Wordpress, I designed a custom scraper to pull the content into
          JSON and process it for the Gulp/Nunjucks engine to consume. I handled nearly every step in the process.

        <p>Join The Pact is a site for people to pledge against drunk driving. I was responsible for website
          architecture, structure, localization, and database design. I translated UI mockups into HTML and CSS using

        <p>Cascade Blonde is a brand of Tennessee whiskey. For their site I handled translating the mockups into HTML,

          interesting
          layout.
